# Password Manager App
A simple Password Manager Tkinter GUI that generates strong random characters for a password and manage which website that password is used for by entering the website name and email. The data is stored in a JSON file. The app can create password, add data to JSON file and search via website name with its associated details. This app highlights the use of intermediate level exception handlers for handling errors.
